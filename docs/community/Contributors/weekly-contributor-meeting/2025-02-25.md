# Weekly Contributor Meeting Notes

(February 25, 2025 4:00 PM PST)

**ETH Denver and Documentation Catch-Up**


## Summary

**Low Attendance:**

*   The meeting started with low attendance, likely due to many contributors being at the ETH Denver conference.
*   One participant expressed FOMO for not attending ETH Denver.

**Project Updates and Status:**

*   **Plugin Migration and Release:** A contributor mentioned that the plugin migration has been done. Release 25.8, that took the weekend to cut, is out.
*   The contributor ran adapters through after noticing someone on chat questioned how they work with the latest release, and found bugs, but they were not in the release.
*   **V2 Status:** Version 2 (V2) of elizaOS is "still kind of broken" and difficult to build on. Several things are waiting to be merged, and a test was planned for later that day.
*   **V1 Core Updates:** Most of the merging work has been focused on plugins, the registry, and updates to the V1 core.
*   **Development Branch:** The `develop` branch is a few PRs ahead of `main` (mostly documentation updates), but the CLI tool (specifically the install part) is currently broken on `develop`. A fix is awaiting approval.
*   **Documentation:** The documentation (particularly the quick start page) is being updated, removing old information and clarifying the flow, especially regarding the moved-out plugins.

**Personal Plans and Discussion:**

*   **Catching Up:** One participant expressed needing to catch up with recent developments, especially regarding Shaw's V2 work.
*   **Getting Eliza Running Again:** The other participant is planning to dive back into running elizaOS (specifically the `develop` branch, despite the known CLI issue) to get hands-on experience. They plan to document their findings and potentially contribute to documentation improvements. The purpose is to present on the agent landscape.
*   **Past Experiences:** They reminisced about the early days of elizaOS, where debugging and getting it running was a community effort in the Discord chat.
*   **Clank Tank:** There was discussion about feedback on Jin's show, Clank Tank, which was mostly positive.

**Hackathons and Future Updates:**

*   It was mentioned that elizaOS is being used extensively in hackathons.
*   There's an expectation of interesting updates next week from contributors who were working on projects for ETH Denver.
